                <p class="lead anout-intro">
                    In addition to being a systems and industrial engineer, I am a person who likes other types of activities. Among them, is
                    my passion for searching and collecting vinyl records of different musical genres, my taste for playing acoustic and electric
                    guitar, and my desire to learn about issues related to leadership, among others. Also, I am a person who likes to do social
                    work to help my community, for example, participating in home construction.
                    <br/>
                    On the other hand, I am a person who likes to drink coffee, especially if it is prepared with regional seeds or if I am with family or friends. In the same way, I am
                    a person who loves food and who always lives with hunger, so I enjoy going out to eat at different restaurants and try different
                    types of food.
